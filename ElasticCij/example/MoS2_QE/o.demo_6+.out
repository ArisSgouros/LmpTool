     Parallel version (MPI), running on     6 processors

     MPI processes distributed on     1 nodes
     1396 MiB available memory on the printing compute node when the environment starts

     Waiting for input...
     Reading input from standard input

     Current dimensions of program PWSCF are:
     Max number of different atomic species (ntypx) = 10
     Max number of k-points (npk) =  40000
     Max angular momentum in pseudopotentials (lmaxx) =  4
     Message from routine setup:
     using ibrav=0 with symmetry is DISCOURAGED, use correct ibrav instead

     R & G space division:  proc/nbgrp/npool/nimage =       6
     Subspace diagonalization in iterative solution of the eigenvalue problem:
     a serial algorithm will be used

!    total energy              =     -57.25091953 Ry
     estimated scf accuracy    <          3.0E-13 Ry

     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:
     one-electron contribution =    -192.53378691 Ry
     hartree contribution      =     102.08494708 Ry
     xc contribution           =     -13.16657839 Ry
     ewald contribution        =      46.36449869 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in   6 iterations

     Total force =     0.000011     Total SCF correction =     0.000001
     SCF correction compared to forces is large: reduce conv_thr to get better values
